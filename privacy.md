# Privacy Policy

## Responsible Party

As an independent app developer, I (the developer) am responsible for the processing of personal data within the scope of this app in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws.

## Data Processing in This App

This application allows users to record and manage their personal expenses. All data entered by users is stored locally on their device and optionally synchronized across their devices using Apple's iCloud service (CloudKit).

I, as the developer, do not collect, store, or have access to any data that users enter into the app. No data is transmitted to servers or services under my control.

## iCloud / CloudKit

The app uses Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) infrastructure to store data in the user's personal iCloud account. The storage, synchronization, and security of this data are managed solely by Apple Inc.

For more information about how Apple handles data stored in iCloud, please refer to Apple’s privacy policy: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## Purpose and Legal Basis

The processing of data (i.e., storing and synchronizing expense records) is performed solely for the purpose of enabling the app’s core functionality. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract).

## Third Parties

No personal data is shared with third parties by me as the app developer. The only third-party service involved is Apple’s iCloud, which is used solely to store and synchronize your data.

## User Rights

According to the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)
- Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)
- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)
- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
- Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)
- Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)

Because I do not have access to your personal data, requests regarding access, correction, or deletion of data stored in iCloud must be directed to Apple or managed directly via your Apple device settings.

## Data Security

All data is stored locally on your device and/or in your personal iCloud account, both of which are protected by Apple’s security measures, including encryption. I do not implement or manage additional security measures beyond those provided by Apple.

## Data Transfers

Please be aware that data stored in iCloud may be processed by Apple on servers located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). For further details, please consult Apple’s privacy documentation.
