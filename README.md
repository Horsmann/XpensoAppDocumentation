If similar expenses occurred in the past, you can load them into the form by tapping on them to save the time to re-enter them.

### Vendor / Category
It is strongly recommended to use the dropdown options (it is possible to disable the necessity to populate them in the settings).
They provided valuable insights for your spending behavior. 
We do not pre-define any values for the expense category field. There is no general granularity of separating expenses which fits for everyone.
You are strongly encouraged to define categories which match your lifestyle and seem relevant for you to track.

The only pre-defined options that exist are for the expense type to provide a bird-view on your expenses.

## Recurring monthly expenses
You can pre-define recurring expenses like rent, electricity payments, which are due every month but also lifestyle subscriptions or saving plans to avoid having to input them every month anew manually. By navigating the date wheel at the bottom you can select a target month into which the expenses are then written / registered on button click.
